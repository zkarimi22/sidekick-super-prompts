# Super Prompts for Sidekick

A simple Chrome Extension to enhance Shopify's Sidekick AI assistant by providing easy access to predefined "super prompts" based on top common use cases from the Shopify merchant community.

## What it Does

*   **Injects Prompts:** Adds a dropdown menu above the Sidekick input in the Shopify Admin.
*   **Community-Driven Prompts:** Select a category (e.g., "product-description", "seo", "customer-support") to see relevant prompt templates inspired by top merchant usage.
*   **One-Click Insertion:** Click a prompt pill to instantly insert it into the Sidekick input field.
*   **Adaptive Sorting:** Learns which categories you use most frequently and sorts the dropdown list to show your favorites first.

## Future Potential (ML & Personalization)

This is a basic proof-of-concept. Future versions could explore:

*   **Smarter Prompt Suggestions:** Analyze the current Shopify admin page context (e.g., product page, orders list) to automatically suggest the most relevant prompt categories or even specific prompts.
*   **Personalized Prompt Generation:** Based on past usage or store data, dynamically generate or refine prompt templates tailored to the specific user or store.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Correlate prompt usage with outcomes (if possible via Sidekick interactions or store metrics) to recommend prompts that lead to better results.
